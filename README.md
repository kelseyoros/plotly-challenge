In this assignment, I built an interactive dashboard to explore the [Belly Button Biodiversity dataset](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/), which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.  Check out the final product [here](https://kelseyoros.github.io/plotly-challenge/BellyButtonBiodiversity/)!

## 
## Steps:

1. I used the D3 library to read in the data, `samples.json`.
2. Created a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.
3. Created a bubble chart that displays each sample.
4. Displayed the sample metadata, i.e., an individual's demographic information.
5. Displayed each key-value pair from the metadata JSON object.
6. Created script that updates all of the plots any time that a new sample is selected.
7. Deployed the app to GitHub Pages
